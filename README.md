This project focuses on a proposed redesign of Tweed Airport. By using web scraping techniques on Yelp and Google reviews, applying reverse image search with AI, and developing Python-based data analysis models, I created a proposal to fix negative passenger experience. Based on my findings, I recommended the addition of three retail stores and one restaurant to the airport.

Retail Stores: Nike, Lululemon, ASOS
Restaurant: Pepe's Pizza

Current Retail/Food department of Tweed Airport: Two Cafe's - Grazing Goat, G Café

I built this website: [tweedreimagined.com](url) to compile my findings and process!
